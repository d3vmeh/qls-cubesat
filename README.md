## Latest Repository Updates
- ReadMe cleanup
- Uploading some final code files




## Old Documentation
We had initially stored some of our early build documentation here in the repository when we started the project. Some of it can be found below!

### Feb 29th to Jan 4th

### Week Summary

  We received our CubeSat kit and built and wired it during our meetings during school. The assembly for the Flat Sat Challenge was pretty straightforward since we were given instructions on how to build the Flat Sat. On Friday after school, we set up the Raspberry Pi and were able to SSH into it. However, we were unable to SSH over WiFi (possibly due to the school blocking it) but it worked when using a mobile hotspot. We also ran code on the Raspberry Pi to take photos with the camera and get data from the IMU. As of now, we have yet to take our team photo and submit it for the Flat Sat Challenge.

## Next Steps


  We plan to first finalize and submit our Flat Sat next week and begin our final project for the course. We will also start brainstorming ideas for our CubeSatâ€™s conceptual design and mission requirements, which will allow us to decide what systems to integrate further down the line. We will continue to work on the online course in parallel with the final project. This week, we will also set up a GitHub repo for the project and make sure to include our code and documentation and work on the GitHub course.
